# JennyWebsite
Portfolio website I'm designing and creating from scratch for my sister, Jenny. This website will help her showcase her experience in front of potential employers as well as enable her to promote herself in a modern way.

## Site Design and layout
The design was created by me. The royal purple and white are representative of my sister's NYU alma mater. NYU is very important to Jenny since that is the school where she got her Master's degree in Counseling.
